They seriously served us sushi on PRINGLES!  I am not even lying.  I forget what appetizer this was we ordered BUT IT CAME OUT ON PRINGLES!  There's inventive and there's cheesey.  Everytime I think about that, I think about Kitchen Nitemares with Gordon Ramsey and what the hell he'd have to say if he was served that. \n\nThat said, the rest of the food was ok--I may go back for the All you can eat sushi, which they started after the Pringles incident, but being served Sushi on Pringles seriously lost this place a star.\n\nPRINGLES!
